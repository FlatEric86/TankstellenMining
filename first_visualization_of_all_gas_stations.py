The intetion is to visualize all petrol stations which are given in the Data Set.
We are going to use a simple geo plot in form of a map of germany as basline with the 
borders of all federal states.
The petrol station are plotted than as scatter-points regarding their locations.
We take into account that some listed petrol station are no more extant. Those
of them we  do ignore.
